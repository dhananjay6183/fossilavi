<h2><a name="life"></a><strong>Early life</strong></h2>

<p> Neymar da Silva Santos Júnior was born in Mogi das Cruzes, São Paulo, to Neymar Santos Sr. and Nadine da Silva. He inherited his name from his father, 
who is a former footballer and became his son's advisor as Neymar's talents began to grow.[14] Neymar comments on his father's role: "My father has been by
 my side since I was little. He takes care of things, my finances and my family."[15] Growing up, Neymar combined his love of futsal with street football.
 [16] Neymar said that futsal had a massive influence on him growing up, helping him develop his technique, speed of thought and ability to perform 
moves in tight spaces.[17]

In 2003, Neymar moved with his family to São Vicente, where he began playing for youth side Portuguesa Santista.[18] Then, later in 2003,
 they moved to Santos, where Neymar joined Santos FC.[19] With the success of his youth career and added income, the family bought their first property, 
 a house next to Vila Belmiro, Santos' home stadium. Their quality of family life improved, as at age 15, Neymar was earning 10,000 reais per month and at 16,
 125,000 reais per month. At 17, he signed his first full professional contract, was upgraded to the Santos first team, and began signing his first
 sponsorship deals.[20]</p>

        <h4><strong>Santos</strong></h4>
		
<p>Youth
Neymar began playing football at an early age and he was soon spotted by Santos FC who offered him a contract in 2003,
 where he was inducted into their youth academy, which has, in the past, produced Brazilian internationals like Coutinho, Clodoaldo, Diego, Elano and Alex. 
 He also joined the likes of Pepe, Pelé and Robinho in starting out his career at the club, nicknamed Peixe.[21] While in the youth academy,
 Neymar met Paulo Henrique Ganso, becoming good friends in the process. Aged 14, Neymar travelled to Spain for try outs with the Real Madrid youth team,
 at the time when Real had stars like Ronaldo, Zinedine Zidane, David Beckham, Roberto Carlos and Robinho. 
He did not stay in Madrid, however, as his father decided at the time that he preferred the young prodigy to keep growing up while playing at Santos</p>

      <h5><strong>barcelona</strong></h5>
	  
<p>On 24 May 2013, Santos announced that they had received two offers for Neymar. The following day, Neymar announced he would sign with Barcelona
 on 27 May 2013 and join the team after playing in the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup. Neither Neymar nor the clubs released details on the transfer fee or
 personal terms, save to say he signed a five-year deal.
[68] On 3 June 2013, Neymar was unveiled by Barcelona after passing medical tests and signing a contract that would keep him at the club through June 2018.
[69]</p>

<p>Neymar was presented at the Camp Nou in front of 56,500 fans, a record turnout for a Brazilian player.[70]
 Club vice-president Josep Maria Bartomeu initially said Neymar's transfer fee was €57.1 million and his release clause set at €190 million.
 [71][72] Barcelona's doctor suggested he might need to gain weight to be able to cope physically in Spanish football.</p>

       <h6><strong>PSG</strong></h6>
	   
	<p>On 3 August 2017, Barcelona announced that Neymar's legal representatives made a payment of €222 million[122] to the club, 
	equal to the release clause of his contract, which constituted the most expensive transfer ever. The club informed UEFA so that 
	they can determine any disciplinary responsibilities that may arise from this case.[8] According to the BBC, in Spain, the release clause 
	must be activated by the footballer himself. The situation was unusual, in that the fee was paid to the club directly, after La Liga had 
	refused to receive the payment.[123][9] Usually, the buyout clause is deposited with La Liga in order to release the player from his contract,
	and the league then passes the money to the selling club. However, La Liga rejected the payment—citing violation of Financial Fair Play (FFP)
	rules by PSG, who are backed by money from Gulf state Qatar.[124]

Neymar joined French club Paris Saint-Germain on a contract that would run until 2022.[125] He was offered the number 10 jersey 
by Javier Pastore as a "welcome gift"</p>

<p>Neymar primarily plays as either a central striker, second striker, winger or occasionally as an attacking midfielder, 
and has been described as "a true phenomenon".[265][266] He often plays as a left sided forward for both club and country in the team's 4–3–3 formation,
 drifting infield, due to his energetic pace and playmaking skills; this position allows him to shoot with his stronger foot, or create chances for teammates.<br />[266] Neymar's dribbling skills, tricks and playmaking ability are reminiscent of compatriot Ronaldinho. His main traits are his creativity, vision, passing, finishing, dribbling, feints, touch, and technique, being described as both "electric" and "explosive".[267][268][269] He is a notable exponent of the rainbow flick.[270] A prolific goalscorer,[271] although naturally right-footed, he is capable of scoring with both feet, as well as with his head, and is an accurate free-kick and penalty taker.[266][272] Neymar stated: "I'm always trying to perfect everything – dribbling, shooting, headers and control. You can always improve".<br />
[15] He has been inspired by Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo, Andrés Iniesta, Xavi and Wayne Rooney.</p>  
	   
<p>Considered to be a highly promising player in his youth,[274] Brazilian playmaker Ronaldinho had also tipped Neymar on becoming the best player in the world, stating in 2013: "Neymar is young though, and I can't explain how special he will become. In the next two or three seasons he will become the best player.<br />"[275] Another Brazilian star, retired World Cup winner Ronaldo also believed that Neymar could become the best in the world, commenting: "Logically, Messi is better right now but Neymar is a great talent who will show the world that he will be number one".<br />[276] Former Real Madrid sporting director Jorge Valdano has also praised Neymar, stating: "I like Neymar a lot. Many of his individual actions result in a goal and often it's a move that only seems to be happening with him on the pitch.<br />"[277] After joining Barcelona, Neymar consequently established himself as one of the best players in world football.</p>
